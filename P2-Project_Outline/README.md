# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I will create and implement a Pictorial Biography App. My app will be designed for a person who wants to collect and present in chronological order photos with descriptive text to memorialize a known person's life in a visually pleasing way in order to memorialize and share with family, friends, and/or fans. Initially, the app will be designed to present data by decade with a maximum of ten sorted sections.

The idea for my app comes from my desire to digitally chronicle the life of my father.

### Features
User Signup and Login: Users will be able to create and log in to his/her account. Each user will have a homepage.

User Homepage with Links to Display or Create Biographical Entries: Users will be able to navigate to decade display pages as well as a diary entry form.

Display Biography by Decade: Users will be able to view their diary entries by separate decades, chronologically.

Diary Entry Form: Users will be able to create new diary entries when logged in, each of which should  include a text description, an entered date, and a related photo image.*

Database: Users will store photos by diary entry and retrieve photos to display.*

*MVP implementation to include at least the text entries and entered dates, but will strive to include the storage, retrieval and display of photo images as well (per instructor input/advice.)

### Technologies
Python

MySQL/php

SQLAlchemy

HTML/CSS

I am still considering whether and what additional technologies may be useful for my application.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to code to store and retrieve images using a local database. I will also consider learning enough JavaScript to determine whether using it may enhance the app in some appreciable way. I also need to review and learn more css for styling the presentation in a visually appealing way.

### Project Tracker
I am still considering which project tracker tool to use, due to my absence and inability to access class materials until this afternoon. I will commit and submit a link with my project planning assignment.
